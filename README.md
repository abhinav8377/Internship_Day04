# 🔐 Task 4 - Firewall Configurations Setup & Usage

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task was to configure and test basic firewall rules on **Windows Firewall** and/or **UFW (Linux)** to allow or block specific types of network traffic.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Windows Firewall (GUI & CLI)
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Checked existing firewall rules.
2. Added a rule to **block inbound traffic** on a specific port (e.g., port 23 for Telnet).
3. Tested the rule locally/remotely to confirm blocking.
4. Configured a rule to **allow SSH (port 22)** on Linux.
5. Removed the block rule to restore original state.
6. Verified changes by re-checking firewall rules.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned
- Basics of firewall configuration.
- Inbound vs Outbound rules.
- Importance of blocking insecure services (e.g., Telnet).
- Traffic filtering with UFW and Windows Firewall.
- How firewalls contribute to network security.
